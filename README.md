# Purpose
This repo contains scripts for working with RNASeq data on the University of Adelaide HPC.  Each folder is divided by program and/or application.
Scripts can be used in conjunction with our [protocols document on Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TbvCCqPcnCx9Xl9MZPZgQquyuG6FG43shAobZbsFB8I/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.l554c6o77bhn), or for most scripts you can add the `-h` or `--help` flags to see what their requirements are.
